# coreutils
Unix core utilities implemented from scratch. The goal is to create a full documented set of coreutils in modern C99, not based on any os or spec, but just with whatever options feel useful to me.

To compile simple run `make` and everything will compile to `./bin`. Make sure to set your path temporarily like so: `PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin" bin/sh`.
